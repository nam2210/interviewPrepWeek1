## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - I have learned about some common question interview such as:
      + find substring
      + reverse string
      + replacing string
  - Always remember String is arrays of character.     
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - they show a way to optimize recursive function. They using a array for store value and use it later
- [x] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - I know what anagram problem is. it is compare 2 strings to find same letters,
  same counts and different orders

**Arrays**

- [x] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - it is bubble sort. It is easy to understanding. You compare 2 elements at n,n-1 position and swap it
- [x] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - there are 2 sort: sort string and sort number
  - Application of sort in search elements
  - there are 5 classification for sort algorithm:
    + time complexity
    + space complexity
    + stability
    + internal sort vs external sort
    + recursive vs non-recursive

- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - this algorithm will divide arrays into 2 group and continues divide that group into smaller group. Finally, there are 2 elements in group and we will compare 2 elements.
  After that we will merge that group together. Merger sort using recursive.

**Coding**

- [x] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.

### Optional tasks

- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
